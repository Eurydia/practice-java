# ELTE/Fall2023 Java practice

## Directories

- `questions/` contains problem sets
- `unit##/` contains tasks and practices completed in each week

Originally, `week ##/` is separated into:

- `week ##/practices/` contains only practices
- `week ##/tasks/` contains only tasks

This is no longer the case due to the way Java project structure works.
